# Fine-tuning-google-gemma-2-2b-it
In this project, we are fine-tuning the google/gemma-2b-it model, which does not natively support function calling. Our goal is to adapt and fine-tune the model to enable function calling capabilities, allowing it to interact with external tools and APIs effectively.
